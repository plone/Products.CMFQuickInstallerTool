Definition:

Make installing auf actions and properties easier. Make them installable over xml definition


Description:

This feature should make actions and proerties installable over xml the feature should be
integradet in CMFQuickinstaller.

Create two files in the Extension Directory of your Product.
One called actions and the other properties.

The first,actions, fill in this way:

<portal_actions>
  name=Testaction
  id=testaction
  action=string:test_form
  condition=member
  permission=View
  category=folder
  visible=1
</portal_daytatool>

<portal_undo> 
  name=Testaction2
  id=testaction2
  action=string:test_form2
  condition=
  permission=ModifyPortalContent
  category=user
  visible=0
</portal_undo>

These two actions are examples. The xml tag provides the name where you
want to install your action. 
The rest are the id value pair you normaly fill in in zmi or you give
to the addAction method from the tool you want to install your action.
Don't change the varnames bevor the '=' these are the parameter names
you give to addAction. The Rest edit in the same way as if you put a new
action to a action provider from zmi.

The second,properties,fill in this way.

<tool_name>
  propertyname=propertyvalue=type
  propertyname=propertyvalue1,propertyvalue2,propertyvalue3=list
  propertyname=1=boolean
</tool_name>

<tool_name>
  propertyname=1=boolean
  propertyname=propertyvalue=type
  propertyname=propertyvalue1,propertyvalue2,propertyvalue3=list
  propertyname=1=boolean
  propertyname=propertyvalue1,propertyvalue2,propertyvalue3=list
</tool_name>
 
 Its the same as making actions over xml the diffrent is that you 
 have to think about is what doc you need for properties.
 You need an property id, a property value, and you have to define the type
 and seperate these three parts with a = like above. Don't care about using = in
 the value part i thought on that. The type name has be the same as the tipe name in zmi
 if you add there a property. If you want install a propertie on portalObject use the portal_url tool
 in tag


Motivation:
  -I don't longer want write the same stuff every time again if i want to install an action
  or a proeprty. 
  -Makes Produkt creation easier

Assumptions:
  -Note but the code i wrote

Proposal:
  -Enlage this code to make the whole product configuration in xml like zope.conf. 
  -Deprecate install.py in this way

Implementation:
  -At this time put it only in your Product directory in future it should be a part
   of quickinstaller

Deliverables:
  -The code is produced

Risks:
  - No Risk

Timeline:
  - It's done only perhaps testing from other people as me to get diffrent opinions and 
    code optimiziatzion
