Tests for QuickInstaller installation
=====================================

First we need to install quickinstaller itself:

  >>> self.setRoles(['Manager'])
  >>> self.addProduct('CMFQuickInstallerTool')

Now set three convenience variables for later use:

  >>> portal = self.app.cmf
  >>> portal
  <CMFSite at /cmf>

  >>> qi = getattr(portal, 'portal_quickinstaller', None)
  >>> qi
  <QuickInstallerTool at /cmf/portal_quickinstaller>

  >>> types_tool = portal.portal_types
  >>> types_tool
  <TypesTool at /cmf/portal_types>


Install a product through an external method
--------------------------------------------

Before installing CMFCalendar as an example lets make sure none of the
installed objects are already present:

  >>> 'Event' in types_tool.objectIds()
  False

  >>> 'portal_calendar' in portal.objectIds()
  False

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is installed:

  >>> 'CMFCalendar' in qi.objectIds()
  False

After checking that the product is not installed yet, we do install it:

  >>> qi.installProducts(products=['CMFCalendar'])
  '...Installed Products...CMFCalendar:ok:...'

Make sure the calendar tool and the Event type are added:

  >>> 'portal_calendar' in portal.objectIds()
  True

  >>> 'Event' in portal.portal_types.objectIds()
  True

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool:

  >>> 'CMFCalendar' in qi.objectIds()
  True

  >>> cal = qi['CMFCalendar']
  >>> cal.isInstalled()
  True

And test if we have a GenericSetup snapshot before and after the installation:

  >>> cal.beforeid
  'qi-before-CMFCalendar-...'

  >>> cal.afterid
  'qi-after-CMFCalendar-...'


Uninstall the product again
---------------------------

  >>> qi.uninstallProducts(products=['CMFCalendar'])

Verify that all added entries were removed again:

  >>> 'Event' in types_tool.objectIds()
  False

  >>> 'portal_calendar' in portal.objectIds()
  False

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is not installed anymore:

  >>> 'CMFCalendar' in qi.objectIds()
  True
  
  >>> cal = qi['CMFCalendar']
  >>> cal.isInstalled()
  False


Install a product through an extension profile
----------------------------------------------

>>> qi.installProducts(products=['CMFCalendar'], forceProfile=True)
'...Installed Products...CMFCalendar:ok:...'

Make sure the calendar tool and the Event type are added:

  >>> 'portal_calendar' in portal.objectIds()
  True

  >>> 'Event' in portal.portal_types.objectIds()
  True

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is installed again:

  >>> 'CMFCalendar' in qi.objectIds()
  True
  
  >>> cal = qi['CMFCalendar']
  >>> cal.isInstalled()
  True

And test if we have a GenericSetup snapshot before and after the installation:

  >>> cal.beforeid
  'qi-before-CMFCalendar-...'

  >>> cal.afterid
  'qi-after-CMFCalendar-...'

Uninstall the product again
---------------------------

  >>> qi.uninstallProducts(products=['CMFCalendar'])

Verify that all added entries were removed again:

  >>> 'Event' in types_tool.objectIds()
  False

  >>> 'portal_calendar' in portal.objectIds()
  False

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is not installed anymore again:

  >>> 'CMFCalendar' in qi.objectIds()
  True
  
  >>> cal = qi['CMFCalendar']
  >>> cal.isInstalled()
  False
