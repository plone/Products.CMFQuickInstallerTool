Tests for QuickInstaller Actions installation
=============================================

First we need to install quickinstaller itself:

  >>> self.addProduct('CMFQuickInstallerTool')

Now set three convenience variables for later use:

  >>> portal = self.app.cmf
  >>> portal
  <CMFSite at /cmf>

  >>> qi = getattr(portal, 'portal_quickinstaller', None)
  >>> qi
  <QuickInstallerTool at /cmf/portal_quickinstaller>

  >>> actions_tool = portal.portal_actions
  >>> actions_tool
  <ActionsTool at /cmf/portal_actions>

Mark CMFQI as not installed, so we can install our test profile:

  >>> qi['CMFQuickInstallerTool'].status = 'uninstalled'

Install a product through an extension profile
----------------------------------------------

  >>> qi.installProducts(products=['CMFQuickInstallerTool'], forceProfile=True)
  '...Installed Products...CMFQuickInstallerTool:ok:...'

Make sure the actions were added:

  >>> 'test1' in [a.id for a in actions_tool.listActions()]
  True

  >>> 'test2' in [a.id for a in actions_tool.listActions()]
  True

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is installed again:

  >>> 'CMFQuickInstallerTool' in qi.objectIds()
  True
  
  >>> qi['CMFQuickInstallerTool'].isInstalled()
  True

Uninstall the product
---------------------

  >>> qi.uninstallProducts(products=['CMFQuickInstallerTool'])

Verify that all added entries were removed again:

  >>> 'test1' in [a.id for a in actions_tool.listActions()]
  False

  >>> 'test2' in [a.id for a in actions_tool.listActions()]
  False

  >>> 'test_category' in actions_tool.objectIds()
  False

And we have an InstalledProduct instance in the QI tool which says the product
is not installed anymore:

  >>> 'CMFQuickInstallerTool' in qi.objectIds()
  True
  
  >>> cmfqi = qi['CMFQuickInstallerTool']
  >>> cmfqi.isInstalled()
  False

TearDown
--------

Make sure the QI tool is still there:

  >>> qi = getattr(portal, 'portal_quickinstaller', None)
  >>> qi
  <QuickInstallerTool at /cmf/portal_quickinstaller>

And mark QuickInstaller as installed again:

  >>> qi['CMFQuickInstallerTool'].status = 'installed'

  >>> cmfqi = qi['CMFQuickInstallerTool']
  >>> cmfqi.isInstalled()
  True
