	<key name="tool" datatype="string"

	  <description>
	    Name of the tool where the actionicon should be
	    installed. If you want to install a property to 
	    PortalObject please choose portal_url. this is because 
	    portal_url is a tool an it provides a method to get
	    PortalObject. I think this is more consistent as 
	    creating a new name for referencing to the Portalobject.
